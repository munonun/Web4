# Web4 — A Stateless, Fully Anonymous Next-Generation Network Model

Web4 is a novel networking model designed to overcome the inherent structural limits of Web3.  
Current decentralized systems rely on permanent ledgers, global ordering, timestamps, and graph structures — making full anonymity mathematically impossible.  
Web4 proposes a radical alternative: a system with _no global history_, _no traceable state_, and _no consensus dependency_, enabling information-theoretic anonymity.

## Why Web4?

Web3 systems (blockchains, DAGs, rollups) fundamentally expose metadata:

- Global ordering leaks correlation patterns
- Graph analysis can deanonymize users
- Permanent ledgers reveal identity through history
- Consensus tends toward centralization
- Perfect anonymity becomes theoretically impossible

Web4 removes the root cause: **the existence of a global record.**

## Core Ideas

- Stateless and history-free communication
- No consensus, no miners, no stakers
- No global ledger (unlike blockchain, DAG, or rollups)
- Information-theoretic anonymity as a design goal
- Self-contained transactions that leave no trace
- Fully open, libre-licensed, community-driven architecture

## Roadmap (Initial)

- Phase 1 — Formalize mathematical model (in progress)
- Phase 2 — Implement minimal PoC of stateless exchange
- Phase 3 — Build reference protocol for developers
- Phase 4 — Provide testnet-like simulation environment
- Phase 5 — Public review and cryptographic evaluation

## Funding goal

I am requesting modest funding (approx. €2500) to support development equipment  
(ARM hardware for testing, additional storage, and compute resources).  
As a young independent researcher, this support enables me to continue work on  
the theoretical model and begin building the PoC in Within February 2026.
